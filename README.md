# pkuseg

## Introduction


pkuseg is an open source semantic segmentation toolbox based on Pytorch which is developed 
by MOE EECS Peking University.


### Major features

- **Modular Desigin and easy to use and deploy**  
   We develop this tool for easier experiments and deployment．
- **All kinds of models for semantic segmentation**  
   We implement many state-of-arts model in research paper.
- **State-of-art results on multiple datsets**  
   We achieve the state-of-art results on multiple datasets including Pascal VOC, Cityscapes, Pascal Context
   and ADE-20k．
